    <h1>FateBound Demo Release Predictions</h1>
    <p>The Demo Of FateBound is Scheduled to release this year in 2025! You know what tha means. Imaginate Games Is gonna launch it's debute game somethime in 2026.</p>
    <p>Here is evey prediction I have for you.</p>
    <h2>Predictions</h2>
    <table>
      <tb>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <p>For our first "prediction", we will say that it is text based and inspired by rpg tabletop games. There is graphics but it's not a graphic based game,<br>
              so it's very limited in the catagory</p>
            <p>Another "prediction" is the 2 chapter demo story you get offering at least 15-30 minutes of playtime if you don't try to speedrun it.</p>
            <p>And the final "predection" I have for you is that the demo game freeplay is mostly available to you. The things you can't get in the demo include<br>
            are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <p>Any gear above rarity epic, So no Legendary, Mythic, Divine, or Set items</p>
              <p>Leveling up past 5</p>
              <p>And finally, No secret missions or 2 player mode</p>
            </ol>
          </ul>
