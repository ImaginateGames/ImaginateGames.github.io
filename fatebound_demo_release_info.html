    <h1>FateBound Demo Release Predictions</h1>
    <p>The Demo of FateBound is scheduled to release this year in 2025! You know what that means—Imaginate Games is going to launch its debut game sometime in 2026.</p>
    <p>Here is every prediction I have for you.</p>

    <h2>Predictions</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>For our first "prediction", we will say that it is text-based and inspired by RPG tabletop games. There are graphics, but it’s not a graphics-based game, so it’s very limited in that category.</li>
            <li>Another "prediction" is that the 2-chapter demo story offers at least 15–30 minutes of playtime—if you don’t try to speedrun it.</li>
            <li>
              The final "prediction" is that the demo freeplay is mostly available to you. The things you can’t get in the demo include:
              <ol>
                <li>Any gear above rarity Epic (no Legendary, Mythic, Divine, or Set items)</li>
                <li>Leveling up past 5</li>
                <li>No secret missions or 2-player mode</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="FateBound_World.png" alt="An image showcasing the FateBound world" style="height: 300px; width: 400px;">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
